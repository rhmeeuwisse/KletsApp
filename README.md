# Klets app
A sample chat app programmed in Node.js.

The app consists of both a client and server component. 

## Running the app
Make sure you have Node.js installed.

Open the console, navigate to sub directory /klets-server and run command 'npm start'. This will start the Klets service running on http://localhost:3030.

Then open another console, navigate to sub directory /klets-client and run command 'npm start'. This will open your browser with http://localhost:3000 with the Klets app. You can open another tab in your browser to simulate multiple clients.
